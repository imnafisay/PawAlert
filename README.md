# PawAlert

**Animal rescue coordination app using GPS-based proximity alerts**

## Overview

PawAlert connects people with animals in need through real-time, location-based notifications. When someone posts a rescue alert, nearby users are instantly notified, ensuring faster response times.

## Problem

In Bangladesh, animal rescue is fragmented across multiple Facebook groups, leading to:
- Posts buried by algorithms
- No centralized coordination
- Delayed responses

## Solution

GPS-based radius notifications ensure help arrives quickly from those closest to the animal.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Cross-platform mobile)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (REST API)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS (Geospatial queries)
- **Maps:** Google Maps API
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Hosting:** Render.com / Railway.dev + Supabase

## Features

- Post rescue alerts with photo & location
- Radius-based push notifications
- Map view of active rescues
- Mark rescues as complete
- User profiles & rescue history
